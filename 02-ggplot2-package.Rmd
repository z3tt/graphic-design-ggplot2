# The Layered Grammar of Graphics {#grammar}

"The Grammar of Graphics" is a general concept for data visualization, proposed by Leland Wilkinson in 2005 [@wilkinson2005]. Based on the earlier work "Semiology of Graphics" by Jacques Bertin [@bertin1983], Wilkinson's "grammar" provides a structured vocabulary for designing and interpreting graphics. Graphics are treated as a language, comprising a set of fundamental components that can be combined and modified to convey insights clearly and coherently.

The grammar of graphics is founded on a layered approach, that define data visualizations as semantic components rather than as predefined chart types. In his view, a graphic is constructed through discrete layers of visual elements, allowing practitioners to create a wide range of visualizations while maintaining a coherent and principled approach. These layers include data, aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, statistical transformations, and scales.

Each layer contributes to the final visualization, enabling the separation of concerns and promoting modularity. *Data* forms the foundation, representing the information to be visualized, while *aesthetic mappings* define how data attributes map to visual properties like size, color, and shape. *Geometric objects* encompass the graphical shapes employed, ranging from points and lines to bars and polygons; *statistical transformations* offer the ability to summarize or transform data, enhancing the analytical power of visualizations. Finally, *scales* help translate data values into perceptually meaningful visual attributes.

## The ggplot2 Package {#ggplot}

In 2005 Hadley Wickham implemented Leland Wilkinson's "The Grammar of Graphics" as an R package called **ggplot2** [@ggplot2]. As in the theoretical concept, **ggplot2** treats data visualizations as a layered combination of components rather than as predefined chart types.

Wickham created the package "as a response to the shortcomings of the current plotting systems" in R (@wickham2006), with the idea to allow building up a graphic from multiple layers of data while handling (shared) axes, colors and other attributes consistently and automatically. The ability to control and combine multiple components makes it a powerful approach to compose complex graphs, iterate quickly over different visual data representations, and modify existing plots.

The package was initially released on June 10, 2007 and has since then become one of the most popular R packages and the standard for producing custom, high-quality graphics in R. The predecessor, the original [**ggplot** package](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot1), was released in 2006 and is made available out of historical interest.

When looking into the package description of the **ggplot2** package, it states the following:

> **ggplot2** is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell **ggplot2** how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

The most important insight from this technical description is that

1.  *we map variables to aesthetics*, i.e. defining the visual channels used to represent the variables (e.g. position, color, shape)
2.  *we use graphical primitives*, i.e. defining one or multiple forms to represent the variables (e.g. lines, points, rectangles)

Both are important when writing **ggplot2** code and together with the provided data they are the key components of a ggplot. Additional components allow to control the visual appearance, the layout, and the coordinate system.

## The Components of a ggplot {#components}

In general, a ggplot is built up from the following components:

1.  ***Data***:\
    The raw data that you want to plot.
2.  ***Aesthetics***:\
    The mapping of variables to visual properties, such as position, color, size, shape, and transparency.
3.  ***Layers:***\
    The representation of the data on the plot panel which is a combination of the *geometric shapes* representing the data and the *statistical transformation* of the data, such as fitted curves, counts, and data summaries.
4.  ***Scales***:\
    The control of the mapping between the data and the aesthetic dimensions, such as data range to positional aesthetics or qualitative or quantitative values to colors.
5.  ***Coordinate system***:\
    The transformation used for mapping data coordinates into the plane of the graphic.
6.  ***Facets***:\
    The arrangement of the data into a grid of plots (also known as *trellis* or *lattice plot*, or simply *small multiples*).
7.  ***Visual themes***:\
    The overall visual (non-data) details of a plot, such as background, grid lines, axes, typefaces, sizes, and colors.

<p class="note">

The number of elements may vary depending on how you group them and whom you ask. This list is based on the list provided in the "ggplot2" book by Hadley Wickham [@ggplot2].

A basic ggplot needs three key components that you have to specify: the *data*, *aesthetics*, and a *layer*. All other additional components can be further modified to customize your graphic.

You can think of a ggplot as a receipt for a dish: it can be based on a few or a diversity of ingredients. Also, you are free to add additional ingredients to spice-up your creation (literally and visually).

Similarly, you can build rather basic charts such as scatter plots, histograms, box-and-whisker plots, or area charts with only a few lines code. But **ggplot2** also allows to create rather complex charts that combine multiple geometries, statistical transformations and maybe even data sets. On top, it is up to you how much effort you take to polish the plot.

You can rely on the defaults used for data-related aesthetics and non-data aspects (as in Fig. \@ref(fig:02ggplotUniqueBabynamesBasic)). Or you decide to modify the data-related aesthetics such as axes and color palettes and/or customize the theme elements of your graphic to your needs (as in Fig. \@ref(fig:02ggplotUniqueBabynamesExplorative)). Or you might even choose a storytelling approach and add additional annotations such as direct labels, shapes, and other highlights to provide context and make a graphic more informative and easier to read (as in Fig. \@ref(fig:02ggplotUniqueBabynamesStorytelling)).

## Key Components

### Data {#data}

Without data, there is no data visualization. Luckily, there are many sources of data available to us: statistics, surveys, experiments, and observations. The data may be collected by governments, researcher labs and organisations, companies---or yourself. However, it is important to consider the quality and context of the data you choose in order to gain accurate and valuable insights.

The ***quality*** of the data we use will have a direct impact on the validity and usefulness of the insights we gain from our data visualization. Poor quality data can lead to incorrect conclusions, while high quality data can provide valuable insights and help us make informed decisions.

In addition to the quality of the data, it is also important to consider the ***context*** in which the data was collected. Different data sources may have different biases or limitations, and it is important to consider these when interpreting and visualizing the data.

Usually, data visualization should be based on real data. At the same time, it is of course possible to create visualizations using hypothetical or simulated data to train yourself or experiment with new chart types. However, you should always keep in mind the origin of the data and communicate the fact clearly to your audience to avoid misleading insights. In order to truly understand and learn from data, we need to work with real, accurate, and reliable data.

Depending on how you want to display your data in **ggplot2**, you have to prepare the data in different formats. The general recommendation is to use a "long format" or "tidy format". In a tidy-form data set, each variable is stored in a column while rows form single observations (\@ref(fig:02imgFormatLongTidyWide)). With such a data set, we can display each variable using a different visual channel, the *aesthetics*, such as position, color and shape (see \@ref(fig:02ggplotAestheticsData) A). Consequently, data in true "long format" (i.e. the variable is specified in a dedicated row) is only useful in case you want to display the variables using the same visual channel (see \@ref(fig:02ggplotAestheticsData) B). A wide format, as you might often find it in case of governmental data, often needs some reshaping except the goal is the representation of a single combination.

```{r 02imgFormatLongTidyWide, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A comparison of data arranged in a long (left) versus wide formats (right). The two different metrics by color. Groups are additionally encoded by shaded rows."}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/table-format-long-tidy-wide.png", dpi = NA)
```

If you need to reshape your data, the `pivot_*()` functions from the **tidyr** package are handy. Use `pivot_longer()` to convert a wide data set into the long or tidy format. To go the other direction, use the `pivot_wider()`. You can find an example in chapter \@ref(tidyr).

### Aesthetics {#aesthetics}

To visualize certain variables in your data set with **ggplot2**, values are mapped to visual channels called *aesthetics*. Aesthetic attributes include positional information such as x and y but also colors, fills, point shapes, line types, sizes, and levels of transparency.

Sticking to our small data set, we could use our tidy-form data (Fig. \@ref(fig:02imgFormatLongTidyWide), top right) to create a scatter plot of the two numeric metrics with the categorical group mapped to color and year mapped to shape (Fig. \@ref(fig:02ggplotAestheticsData) A). However, we could also use the long-form data (Fig. \@ref(fig:02imgFormatLongTidyWide), top left) to show the metrics as a group wise dot plot and encode the metrics by color (Fig. \@ref(fig:02ggplotAestheticsData) B).

```{r 02ggplotAestheticsData, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic ggplot outputs mapping four different variables (columns of the data set) to aesthetics, using the long-format data (`data_long`, left plot) and wide-format data (`data_wide`, right plot). Lines connecting the groups were added to make the difference between both plots more obvious."}
data_long <- tibble::tibble(
  group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), 4),
  year = rep(rep(c("2022", "2023"), each = 3), 2),
  metric = c(rep("x", 6), rep("y", 6)),
  value = c(46, 2, 21, 32, 16, 7, 12, 35, 24, 1, 42, 27)
)

data_tidy <- tidyr::pivot_wider(
  data = data_long, 
  names_from = metric,
  values_from = value,
  names_prefix = "metric_"
)

pt <- ggplot(data_tidy, aes(x = metric_x, y = metric_y, shape = year, color = group)) +
  layer(geom = "point", stat = "identity", position = "identity", params = list(size = 3.5)) +
  ## or `geom_point(size = 3.5)` with stat = "identity" and position = "identity" as default
  ## or `stat_identity(size = 3.5)` with geom = "point" and position = "identity" as default
  geom_line(aes(group = group), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors[c(2,4,5)]) +
  theme(legend.justification = "top")

pl <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = group, y = value, shape = year, color = metric)) +
  layer(geom = "point", stat = "identity", position = "identity", params = list(size = 3.5)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = interaction(group, metric)), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors[c(1,3)]) +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(order = 1), color = guide_legend(order = 2)) +
  theme(legend.justification = "top")

pt + plot_spacer() + pl +
  plot_layout(widths = c(1, .05, 1)) +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A", tag_suffix = ")")
```

<p class="note">

The optimal shape of your data set relates to the plot you have in mind. Stick to the rule that any variable that you want to use for an aesthetic should have a dedicated column.

</p>

### Layers {#layers}

Layers in **ggplot2** define the the statistical transformation, geometrical representation, and positional adjustment of the mapped values. In the example above, we have used a layer with geometry "point" and without any statistical transformation or positional adjustment. This specification simply means "draw the raw values as points by using the specified aesthetics of position, color, and shape".

Statistical transformation are responsible for calculating summaries such as counts and averages. You can also perform more advanced transformations of the data such as calculating smoothings and densities. If there is any statistical transformation specified, the calculation is applied to the data before they are plotted.

The raw or transformed data are then used to draw the specified geometrical object(s), representing the parsed data e.g. as points, bars, or lines. On top, you can also adjust the position of the geometries. Examples for positional adjustments are the grouping or stacking of bars or the jittering of points.

For example, you might use a statistical transformation to calculate linear regression lines to fit them to your variables mapped to x and y and display them as banded lines (geometrical object). Or you might decide to show the raw data as points without any statistical transformation (Fig. \@ref(fig:02ggplotLayersGeomsStats)).

```{r, 02ggplotLayersGeomsStats, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The same data, visualized as  a scatter plot showing the raw data without any statistical transformation (left) and after a statistical tranformation has been applied to calculate linear fittings for each Penguin species (right). The visualizations use the Palmer Archipelago penguin data by A.M. Horst, A.P. Hill & K.B. Gorman (2020)."}
library(palmerpenguins)

p <- 
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g / 1000, color = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Body mass (kg)", color = NULL)
  
p1 <- p + geom_point(aes(color = species))

p2 <- p + stat_smooth(aes(color = species), method = "lm")

p1 + plot_spacer() + p2 +
  plot_layout(widths = c(1, .05, 1)) +
  plot_annotation(caption = "Data: {palmerpenguins} doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3960218")
```

In general, each layer in a ggplot is created using a separate function call. For each layer, you can specify the visual appearance, such as color, and size, independently by *setting properties* (e.g. turn all points green) or *mapping aesthetics* (e.g. base the color on the group variable). This allows you to build up a complex plot by adding and customizing individual layers, giving you fine-grained control over the appearance of your plots.

```{r, 02ggplotLayersCombinedPenguins, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Three different visualizations showing the distribution of body mass across three penguin species. A) A box-and-whiskers plot using a single layer. B) Adding a second layer to plot A allows to show the raw data as jittered points. C) By combining multiple layers, one can build more complex visualizations like this variant of a raincloud plot. Four layers are used here: one for the density curve, one for the pointrange, another one for the barcode strip and finally one for the annotation with the mean values. The visualizations use the Palmer Archipelago penguin data by A.M. Horst, A.P. Hill & K.B. Gorman (2020)."}

```

The layered approach allows to create a wide range of charts and graphics. One can also create more complex, potentially unusual graphics as it allows you to combine layers in a traditional but also nontraditional way as you like.

## Additional Components

The following components are set by default but can be tweaked to:

-   adjust the properties of the aesthetics (*scales*)
-   control the mapping of positional aesthetics (*coordinate systems*)
-   create small multiples of the specified chart (*facets*)
-   modify non-data related elements (*themes*)

### Scales {#scales}

Scales translate between the value range of our data, mapped to aesthetics, and the perceptual property range. Every time you map a column to an aesthetic, a respective suitable scale component is added to your plot.

To modify the default settings you can specify your own scale, for example tweak the number of axis ticks or customize the colors used to encode groups. Furthermore, scales are also used to transform the data before it is processed by the layer. An example of transforming the values with a scale component is the display of the data in discrete bins.

### Coordinate Systems {#coords}

Coordinate systems interpret the position aesthetics. By default, a Cartesian coordinate system is used to encode the x and y aesthetics. As this is likely the most common type in data visualization, you might modify coordinate systems only in two cases: creating circular plots such as pie charts and circular barplots or when projecting spatial data.

### Facets {#facets}

Facets split variables to multiple panels, allowing to create the same visualization for several combinations. Such small multiples can be a powerful tool to show high-dimensional data, to explore big data sets, and to compare patterns across variables and groups.

A special case of facets are geo-referenced small multiples: a set of visualizations is laid out in a grid that represents the original topography. Such graphics can be easily created in **ggplot2** with the help of the **geofacet** extension package.

### Themes {#themes}

Themes encode all non-data elements of your plots such as the typeface, background colors, and titles and captions. **ggplot2** comes with a set of complete themes that can be added to your plot and further modified with high flexibility.

The modified themes can easily be turned into your own custom theme function which can be used as a component in the same way. Also, several extension packages such as **ggthemes**, **hrbrthemes** or **tvthemes** provide even more complete themes to change the look of your visualization.

The ability to use pre-coded themes is a great feature as it allows for a consistent and corporate style while saving time to write the same code over and over again.
