I planned to create a visualization using small multiples to show various outcomes of the scenarios I ran with my simulation model. I was already using the R programming language for years and quickly came across the graphics library ggplot2 which comes with the functionality to easily create small multiples. I never liked the syntax and style of base plots in R, so I immediately fell in love with the idea and implementation of ggplot2’s Grammar of Graphics. But because I was short on time, I plotted these figures by trial and error and with the help of lots of googling. The resource I came always back to was a blog entry called “Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet” by Zev Ross. After giving the talk which contained some decent plots thanks to the blog post, I decided to go through this tutorial step-by-step. I learned so much from it and directly started modifying the codes and adding additional code snippets, chart types, and resources. Fast forward to 2019. I successfully finished my PhD and started participating in a weekly data visualization challenge called #TidyTuesday. Every week, a raw data set is shared with the aim to explore and visualize the data with ggplot2. Thanks to my experience with the tidyverse and especially ggplot2 during my PhD and the open-source approach of the challenge that made it possible to learn from other participants, my visualizations quickly became more advanced and complex. A few months later, I had built a portfolio of various charts and maps and decided to start working as an independent data visualization specialist. I am now using ggplot2 every day: for my academic work, design requests, reproducible reports, educational purposes, and personal data visualization projects. What I especially love about my current job specification: It challenges and satisfies my creativity on different levels. Besides the creativity one can express in terms of chart choice and design, there is also creativity needed to come up with solutions and tricks to bring the most venturous ideas to life. At the same time, there is the gratification when your code works and magically translates code snippets to visuals. The blog entry by Zev Ross was not updated since January 2016, so I decided to add more examples and tricks to my version, which was now hosted on my personal blog. Step by step, my version became a unique tutorial that now contains for example also the fantastic patchwork, ggtext and ggforce packages, a section of custom fonts and colors, a collection of R packages tailored to create interactive charts, and several new chart types. The updated version now contains ~3.000 lines of code and 188 plots and received a lot of interest from ggplot2 users from many different professional fields. On a sunny day in July 2021, this tutorial served as the starting point for the book you hold in your hands. Plans changed a lot over the time and the book became something unique, that is loosely based on the tutorial and a 2-day workshop I was honored to teach at the rstudio::conf(2022) in Washington DC. In addition, I decided to include more advanced tips and insights in the process of creating custom, engaging data visualizations with ggplot2. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed learning and sharing ggplot2 wizardry! Why read this book Often, people that use common graphic design and charting tools or have basic experience with ggplot2 cannot believe what one can achieve with this graphics library—and I want to show you how one can create a publication-ready graphic that goes beyond the traditional scientific scatter or box plot. ggplot2 is already used by a large and diverse group of graduates, researchers, and analysts and the current rise of R and the tidyverse will likely lead to an even increasing interest in this great plotting library. While there are many tutorials on ggplot2 tips and tricks provided by the R community, to my knowledge there is no book that specifically addresses the complete design of specific details up to building an ambitious multipanel graphic with ggplot2. As a blend of strong grounding in academic foundations of data visualization and hands-on, practical codes, and implementation material, the book can be used as introductory material as well as a reference for more experienced ggplot2 practitioners. The book is intended for students and professionals that are interested in learning ggplot2 and/or taking their default ggplots to the next level. Thus, the book is potentially interesting for ggplot2 novices and beginners, but hopefully also helpful and educational for proficient users. Among other things, the book covers the following: Look-up resource for every-day and more specific ggplot adjustments and design options Practical hands-on introduction to ggplot2 to quickly build appealing visualization Discussion of best practices in data visualization (e.g. color choice, direct labeling, chart type selection) along the way Coverage of useful ggplot2 extension packages Ready-to-start code examples Reference implementations illustrating code solutions and design choices How to read this book This book can either serve as a textbook or as a reference.

How we present data affects the engagement of and interpretation by the audience. Showing data in an honest, meaningful—and maybe sometimes even playful or artistic—way is the art of data visualization or information visualization. Data visualization can be described as the transformation of numbers into visual quantities, encoded by forms, positions, and colors. The transformation allows us to see patterns and trends in data and identify relationships between different variables. In the best case, a well-designed data visualization helps to amplify cognition, facilitate insights, discover, spark curiosity, explain, and make decisions. Data visualizations, or broadly speaking information graphics, are often classified as being either exploratory or explanatory. Exploratory graphics are generated to understand the data and search for the relevant information. Explanatory graphics aim to communicate the derived information between people (Koponen and Hildén 2019). In contrast to exploratory graphics, the creation of engaging explanatory graphics involves not only the display of data but also requires many choices with regard to the storytelling and design. When designing visualizations myself or looking at the work of others, the most important question to me is the purpose of the graphic. Without a clear understanding of the purpose, it is impossible to design an effective and engaging visualization. The same applies when evaluating a visualization: without the consideration of the purpose—the audience, the message, the mood—the designer had in mind when creating the visualization, the critique of design choices often becomes obsolete. A common assumption is that the single aim of data visualizations is to guide decisions. This might be true for business or scientific applications that aim for precision and accuracy by creating pragmatic visualizations (Kosara 2007). At the same time, it is ignorant to assume that efficiency and functionality are the main purpose of every visualization. Many of the great visualizations we have seen and that stick to our mind go beyond the precise, informative display of data1. They experiment with new approaches, use clever, unusual ways to tell stories or were designed simply to transport joy, curiosity or concern. In some cases, the design and visual novelty may even be the main focus with the aim to create a novel, artistic experience for the viewer. Such artworks are not necessarily created to maximize discovery or communication but to elicit emotions and can be termed affective graphics2. As a creator, clearly defining the purpose of a visualization helps to make decisions about the data, the chart type, and the design. As a reader, identifying the purpose helps rating the quality of the presentation. Some people like to think that there is a single best approach to visualize data: the one that has survived the test of time and is the most efficient to quantify information. Some believe that a chart has to be designed in a *neutral* way. I strongly disagree with both opinions, for multiple reasons. The most important: Every time we present the data, we make decisions; and it is not about if we make decisions but which. Chart types are not inherently ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ but might be more or less suitable for the purpose. Colors are associated with some emotional value—how could we pick one that has a neutral meaning, association or emotion for every person that might look at your visualization? Even if we agree on the ‘right’ decisions—the best chart type and a neutral color encoding, likely some shades of grey—we still can’t ensure that all people interpret it in the same way. People will always find their own message in graphs and the interpretation will likely differ based on individual differences through culture, attitude and mood. A quote from Alberto Cairo that is close to my heart sums it up brilliantly: Visualizations can be designed and experienced in various ways, by people of various backgrounds, and in various circumstances. That’s why reflecting on the purpose of a visualization is paramount before we design it—or before we critique it. (Cairo 2021) In the optimal case, the decisions made by the creator are based on some thoughtful consideration of the following: data — which information is meaningful and robust? audience — what do readers already know? context — how will the reader encounter the visualization? story — what is the main message of the visualization? goal — which chart type is suitable to transport the story? design — how can I facilitate engagement and understanding? While some decisions might (and should) be made before crafting the visualization, the creation of purposeful, well-designed graphics is an iterative process. Rarely3 the first draft is what ends up being printed on physical material or being displayed on your computer or smartphone screen. Nowadays, computational approaches ease the cyclic process of prototyping, exploring, testing, and designing the best visual encoding of information for a given purpose. 1.2 Coding Visualizations As data visualizations involve the quantitative representation of variables, an environment that allows to handle, wrangle and quantify data is preferential. Classical design software is great to create vector-based graphics of all kinds but must often be paired with a ‘visualization tool’ if the data and/or the chart type becomes more complex. While there are many tools that allow to quickly create specific, predefined chart types (e.g. DataWrapper, Flourish, RAWgraphs), often also with beautiful and very sensible defaults, such chart builders usually do not provide full flexibility. By using a computational, code-driven approach we can combine all steps related to data visualization in the same environment: from the data import and cleaning to the precise and flexible encoding of quantitative information with custom designs. Programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, or R have a much steeper learning curve than chart builders but at the same time allow users to create almost any visualization one can think of. Furthermore, they come with several extension libraries (e.g. D3.js, echarts, Vega, Matplotlib, ggplot2) that provide additional approaches or add more opportunities to existing code. Data visualizations that are generated with code have several other benefits. The reproducibility of code makes the process more efficient by being able to update the data or to use the code as a template for future projects. The transparency of coded (and well-documented) data workflows increases trust. The scalability of code allows to produce the graphics for multiple data sets and use cases. Of course, the visualization does not need to be created by code alone. Switching from a code-based approach to a vector-graphics tool makes a lot of sense in use cases where reproducibility does not matter or graphics are stand-alone artworks. Honestly, in terms of efficiency and freedom, a combined approach is likely the best approach in such a case. With that in mind, knowing how to code visualizations is likely beneficial in any data-related field. 1.3 Why R and ggplot2 As a computational ecologist, I’ve learned and used a range of different tools and programming languages for various purposes such as data wrangling, statistical analyses, and model building. The open-source language R was and is the programming language most widely used by ecologists to handle and analyze ecological data (Sciaini et al. 2018). Consequently, I was of course using R in my daily life as a scientific researcher. Nowadays, R plays a crucial part in many data-related workflows, no matter if for scientific, educational, or industrial use cases. Thanks to the ever growing R community and the rich collection of libraries that add additional functionality and simplify workflows, R is an attractive programming language that has outgrown of its original purpose: statistical analyses. Today, R can serve as tool to generate automated reports, develop stand-alone web apps, and draft presentation slides, books, and web pages. And to design high-level, publication–ready visualizations. Even though R—similar to most programming languages—has a steep learning curve, the level of functionality, flexibility, automation, and reproducibility offered can be a major benefit also in a design context: The layered approach of ggplot2 opens the possibility to build any type of visualization. Various extension packages add missing functionality. Script-based workflows instead of point–and–click approaches allow for reproducibility—which means you can run the code again after receiving new data or create thousands of visualizations for various data sets in no time. Sharing code is becoming the golden standard in many fields and thus facilitates transparency and credibility as well as reuse and creative advancement. A helpful community and many free resources simplify learning experiences and the search for solutions. The visualizations created in R can be exported as vector files and thus allow for post–processing with vector graphics software like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape or Figma.

The idea of both, the theoretical concept and its implementation in ggplot2, is that data visualizations can be defined as semantic components rather than as predefined chart types. The ability to control and combine multiple components makes it a powerful approach to compose complex graphs, iterate quickly over different visual data representations, and modify existing plots. Furthermore, it allows for a comprehensive and consistent syntax to describe and build data visualizations. The package was intially released on June 10, 2007 and has since then become one of the most popular R packages and the standard for producing custom, high-quality graphics in R. The predessor, the original ggplot package, was released in 2006 and is made available out of historical interest. When looking into the package description of the ggplot2 package, it states the following: ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. The most important insight from this technical description is that we map variables to aesthetics, i.e. defining the visual channels used to represent the variables (e.g. position, color, shape) we use graphical primitives, i.e. definining one or multiple forms to represent the variables (e.g. lines, points, rectangles) Both are important when writing ggplot2 code and together with the provided data they are the key components of a ggplot. Additional components allow to control the visual appearance, the layout, and the coordinate system. 2.2 The Components of a ggplot In general, a ggplot is built up from the following components: Data: The raw data that you want to plot. Aesthetics: The mapping of variables to visual properties, such as position, color, size, shape, and transparency. Layers: The representation of the data on the plot panel which is a combination of the geometric shapes representing the data and the statistical transformation of the data, such as fitted curves, counts, and data summaries. Scales: The control of the mapping between the data and the aesthetic dimensions, such as data range to positional aesthetics or qualitative or quantitative values to colors. Coordinate system: The transformation used for mapping data coordinates into the plane of the graphic. Facets: The arrangement of the data into a grid of plots (also known as trellis or lattice plot, or simply small multiples). Visual themes: The overall visual (non-data) details of a plot, such as background, grid lines, axes, typefaces, sizes, and colors. The number of elements may vary depending on how you group them and whom you ask. This list is based on the list provided in the “ggplot2” book by Hadley Wickham (Wickham 2016). A basic ggplot needs three key components that you have to specify: the data, aesthetics, and a layer. All other additional components can be further modified to customize your graphic. You can think of a ggplot as a receipt for a dish: it can be based on a few or a diversity of ingredients. Also, you are free to add additional ingredients to spice-up your creation (literally and visually). Similarly, you can build rather basic charts such as scatter plots or histograms with only a few lines code. But ggplot2 also allows to create rather complex charts that combine multiple geometries, statistical transformations and maybe even data sets. On top, it is up to you how much effort you take to polish the plot. You can rely on the defaults used for data-related aesthetics (e.g. default axis breaks and color palettes) and non-data aspects (e.g. complete themes). Or you decide to modify the data-related aesthetics such as axes and color palettes and/or customize the theme elements of your graphic to your needs. 2.3 Key Components 2.3.1 Data Without data, there is no data visualization. Luckily, there are many sources of data available to us: statistics, surveys, experiments, and observations. The data may be collected by governments, researcher labs and organisations, companies—or yourself. However, it is important to consider the quality and context of the data you choose in order to gain accurate and valuable insights. The quality of the data we use will have a direct impact on the validity and usefulness of the insights we gain from our data visualization. Poor quality data can lead to incorrect conclusions, while high quality data can provide valuable insights and help us make informed decisions. In addition to the quality of the data, it is also important to consider the context in which the data was collected. Different data sources may have different biases or limitations, and it is important to consider these when interpreting and visualizing the data. Usually, data visualization should be based on real data. At the same time, it is of course possible to create visualizations using hypothetical or simulated data to train yourself or experiment with new chart types. However, you should always keep in mind the origin of the data and communicate the fact clearly to your audience to avoid misleading insights. In order to truly understand and learn from data, we need to work with real, accurate, and reliable data. Depending on how you want to display your data in ggplot2, you have to prepare the data in different formats. The general recommendation is to use a “long format” or “tidy format”. In a tidy-form data set, each variable is stored in a column while rows form single observations (2.1). With such a data set, we can display each variable using a different visual channel, the aesthetics, such as position, color and shape (see 2.2 A). Consequently, data in true “long format” (i.e. the variable is specified in a dedicated row) is only useful in case you want to display the variables using the same visual channel (see 2.2 B). A wide format, as you might often find it in case of governmental data, often needs some reshaping except the goal is the representation of a single combination. FIGURE 2.1: A comparison of data arranged in a long (left) versus wide formats (right). The two different metrics by color. Groups are additionally encoded by shaded rows. If you need to reshape your data, the pivot_*() functions from the tidyr package are handy. Use pivot_longer() to convert a wide data set into the long or tidy format. To go the other direction, use the pivot_wider(). You can find an example in chapter 3.2.5.2. 2.3.2 Aesthetics To visualize certain variables in your data set with ggplot2, values are mapped to visual channels called aesthetics. Aesthetic attributes include positional information such as x and y but also colors, fills, point shapes, line types, sizes, and levels of transparency. Sticking to our small data set, we could use our tidy-form data (2.1, top right) to create a scatter plot of the two metrics (2.2 A). However, we could also use the long-form data (2.1, top left) to show the metrics as a group wise dot plot and encode the metrics by shape(2.2 B). FIGURE 2.2: Basic ggplot outputs mapping four different variables (columns of the data set) to aesthetics, using the long-format data (data_long, left plot) and wide-format data (data_wide, right plot). Lines connecting the groups were added to make the difference between both plots more obvious. The optimal shape of your data set relates to the plot you have in mind. Stick to the rule that any variable that you want to use for an aesthetic should have a dedicated column. 2.3.3 Layers Layers in ggplot2 define the the statistical transformation, geometrical representation, and positional adjustment of the mapped values. In the example above, we have used a layer with geometry “point” and without any statistical transformation or positional adjustment. This specification simply means “draw the raw values as points by using the specified aesthetics of position, color, and shape”. Statistical transformation are responsible for calculating summaries such as counts and averages. You can also perform more advanced transformations of the data such as calculating smoothings and densities. If there is any statistical transformation specified, the calculation is applied to the data before they are plotted. The raw or transformed data are then used to draw the specified geometrical object(s), representing the parsed data e.g. as points, bars, or lines. On top, you can also adjust the position of the geometries. Examples for positional adjustments are the grouping or stacking of bars or the jittering of points. For example, you might use a statistical transformation to calculate linear regression lines to fit them to your variables mapped to x and y and display them as banded lines (geometrical object). Or you might decide to show the raw data as points without any statistical transformation (2.3). FIGURE 2.3: The same data, visualized as a scatter plot showing the raw data without any statistical transformation (left) and after a statistical tranformation has been applied to calculate linear fittings for each Penguin species (right). The visualizations use the Palmer Archipelago penguin data by A.M. Horst, A.P. Hill &amp; K.B. Gorman (2020). In general, each layer in a ggplot is created using a separate function call. For each layer, you can specify the visual appearance, such as color, and size, independently by setting properties (e.g. turn all points green) or mapping aesthetics (e.g. base the color on the group variable). This allows you to build up a complex plot by adding and customizing individual layers, giving you fine-grained control over the appearance of your plots. FIGURE 2.4: Three different visualizations showing the distribution of body mass across three penguin species. A) A box-and-whiskers plot using a single layer. B) Adding a second layer to plot A allows to show the raw data as jittered points. C) By combining multiple layers, one can build more complex visualizations like this variant of a raincloud plot. Four layers are used here: one for the density curve, one for the pointrange, another one for the barcode strip and finally one for the annotation with the mean values. The visualizations use the Palmer Archipelago penguin data by A.M. Horst, A.P. Hill &amp; K.B. Gorman (2020). The layered approach allows to create a wide range of charts and graphics. One can also create more complex, potentially unusual graphics as it allows you to combine layers in a traditional but also nontraditional way as you like. 2.4 Additional Components The following components are set by default but can be tweaked to: adjust the properties of the aesthetics (scales) control the mapping of positional aesthetics (coordinate systems) create small multiples of the specified chart (facets) modify non-data related elements (themes) 2.4.1 Scales Scales translate between the value range of our data, mapped to aesthetics, and the perceptual property range. Every time you map a column to an aesthetic, a respective suitable scale component is added to your plot. To modify the default settings you can specify your own scale, for example tweak the number of axis ticks or customize the colors used to encode groups. Furthermore, scales are also used to transform the data before it is processed by the layer. An example of transforming the values with a scale component is the display of the data in discrete bins. 2.4.2 Coordinate Systems Coordinate systems interpret the position aesthetics. By default, a Cartesian coordinate system is used to encode the x and y aesthetics. As this is likely the most common type in data visualization, you might modify coordinate systems only in two cases: creating circular plots such as pie charts and circular barplots or when projecting spatial data. 2.4.3 Facets Facets split variables to multiple panels, allowing to create the same visualization for several combinations. Such small multiples can be a powerful tool to show high-dimensional data, to explore big data sets, and to compare patterns across variables and groups. A special case of facets are geo-referenced small multiples: a set of visualizations is laid out in a grid that represents the original topography. Such graphics can be easily created in ggplot2 with the help of the geofacet extension package. 2.4.4 Themes Themes encode all non-data elements of your plots such as the typeface, background colors, and titles and captions. ggplot2 comes with a set of complete themes that can be added to your plot and further modified with high flexibility. The modified themes can easily be turned into your own custom theme function which can be used as a component in the same way. Also, several extension packages such as ggthemes, hrbrthemes or tvthemes provide even more complete themes to change the look of your visualization. The ability to use pre-coded themes is a great feature as it allows for a consistent and corporate style while saving time to write the same code over and over again. 2.5 Showcase The following collection of graphics illustrate the power and versatility of ggplot2—and a range of extension packages—to create customized, partly uncommon or complex charts. All these charts are the outcome of 100% R code, making use of multiple layers and customized colors, fonts, and themes.

Two layers, a dot plot and an interval strip, are used to highlight the distribution. Two different triangles highlight minimum (red and empty) and median (black and filled) scores. Text layers indicate the scores next to the triangles as well as the respective country at the begin of each interval. [WIP] FIGURE 2.6: “Not my Cup of Coffee” by Cédric Scherer Tanya Shapiro used a “jitter-pop” chart—a cmbination of jitter strips and lollipops—to visualize several average IMDb scores of the TV series “Doctor Who”. Small jittered points show the average scores for each season, colored by doctor. The large circular images show visualize the average score per doctor with horizontal lines indicating the deviation from the overall average score (vertical line). This graphic combines five different layers: jittered points, images, text annotations, and horizontal and vertical lines. the package makes use of the extension packages … [WIP] FIGURE 2.7: “Doctor Who was the Best?” by Tanya Shapiro These are just a few examples of the many types of charts that you can create using ggplot2. With a little creativity and experimentation, you can come up with your own unique and informative visualizations or artful pieces.

The data was collected from the TfL data base and is ‘Powered by TfL Open Data’. The processed data set contains hourly information on the number of rented bikes and was combined with weather data acquired from freemeteo.com.

FIGURE 3.2: Overview of the distribution of the boolean variables is_workday, is_weekend, and is_holiday (A), the categorical variable weather_type (B), and the continuous variables count, temp, temp_feel, humidity, and wind_speed (C) of the cleaned and aggregated bike sharing data set. In panel C, the correlation between the variables is shown as scatterplot encoded by timeperiod (upper triangle) and encoded by point density (lower triangle), highlighting the level of overlap of data points.

However, the knowledge of certain basic principles is at least helpful and probably indispensable for advanced plots. This section will give you a short overview of workflows and the very basics needed. The overview makes use of the tidyverse, a package collection designed for data science in R. However, multiple other options exist to import, inspect, and wrangle your data if you prefer not to work with the tidyverse for these steps4. 3.2.1 Import data You need to import data to be able to work with it in the current session. The data can be imported from a local directory or directly from a web source. Nowadays, all common and some less common data formats can easily be imported. For common tabular data formats such as .txt or .csv one can use the readr package (Wickham, Hester, and Bryan 2022) from the tidyverse. We use the read_csv() function to load the TfL data as .csv file directly from a web URL. To access the URL and data later, we are storing the link as url_data and the data set as bikes by using the assignment arrow &lt;-. The col_types argument within the read_csv() function allows to specify the column types. For example, i represents integer values, f encodes factors, and l turns a column into a logical, boolean variable that only can have two states, TRUE or FALSE. You’ll find more on the different data types later in this chapter. url_data &lt;- &quot;https://cedricscherer.com/data/london-bikes.csv&quot; bikes &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = url_data, col_types = &quot;Dcfffilllddddfc&quot;) The :: is called “namespace” and can be used to access a function without loading the package. Here, you could also run library(readr) first and bikes &lt;- read_csv(url_data) afterwards. If you want to load data that is stored locally, you specify the path to the file instead: path_data &lt;- &quot;C://path/to/my/data/london-bikes.csv&quot; ## mocked-up name for Win users bikes &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = path_data, col_types = &quot;Dcfffilllddddfc&quot;) Note that the syntax of the path differs between operating systems. While in Windows subdirectories are separated with backslashes, Mac and Linux uses slashes. Also, absolute paths differ in their syntax: Windows machines specify the drive letter, hereC://, or the server name; on Mac/Linux machines absolute paths start with /users/. Instead of relying on the absolute path, which likely differs between users and operating systems, you can also use relative paths. Those are specified with a leading dot, e.g. as ./data/london-bikes.csv, and look for the file relative from the working directory. You can retrieve and change your working directory with getwd() and setwd(). However, relying on the default working directory or setting a custom one will likely cause problems the moment someone else wants to run your code5. 3.2.2 Project-oriented workflows Preferably, we do not want to rely on absolute paths and the default or manually set working directories. So-called project-oriented workflows aim to organize each piece of work in a self-contained, bundled directory. This directory includes all relevant files needed for the project, such as scripts and images. By ensuring that paths are set relative and in a way that they are understood by any operating system, we guarantee that the project will run on any machine and can easily moved around. If you are working in Rstudio, Rstudio projects provide such a project-oriented workflow. When opening the project via the associated .Rproj file, it ensures that the working directory is correctly set and points to the project’s top-level directory (i.e. the folder that contains the .Rproj file). When using Rstudio projects, a helpful package to navigate to files of interest is the here package. The function here() will create paths relative to the top-level directory: ## point to the csv inside the &quot;data&quot; subdirectory of the project directory path_data &lt;- here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;london-bikes.csv&quot;) 3.2.3 Inspect data After importing the data, it is advisable to have a look at the data. Does the object stored in R match the dimensions of your original data file? Are the variables displayed correctly? You can print the data by simply running the name of the object, here bikes. bikes ## # A tibble: 1,454 × 14 ## date day_ni…¹ year month season count is_wo…² ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 2015-01-04 day 2015 1 3 6830 FALSE ## 2 2015-01-04 night 2015 1 3 2404 FALSE ## 3 2015-01-05 day 2015 1 3 14763 TRUE ## 4 2015-01-05 night 2015 1 3 5609 TRUE ## 5 2015-01-06 day 2015 1 3 14501 TRUE ## 6 2015-01-06 night 2015 1 3 6112 TRUE ## 7 2015-01-07 day 2015 1 3 16358 TRUE ## 8 2015-01-07 night 2015 1 3 4706 TRUE ## 9 2015-01-08 day 2015 1 3 9971 TRUE ## 10 2015-01-08 night 2015 1 3 5630 TRUE ## # … with 1,444 more rows, 7 more variables: ## # is_weekend &lt;lgl&gt;, is_holiday &lt;lgl&gt;, temp &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # temp_feel &lt;dbl&gt;, humidity &lt;dbl&gt;, wind_speed &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # weather_type &lt;fct&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​day_night, ²​is_workday As we have used the readr package, our data is stored as a tibble (class tbl_df and related) which is the tidyverse subclass of a traditional data frame (class data.frame). There are other data structures in R such as lists and matrices; however, in this book we are going to use only data frames, more precisely tibbles (besides spatial data formats in Chapter XYZ). On the top of the output, you can directly see that our data set consists of format(length(bikes), big.mark = \",\") variables (columns) frame with 1,454 observations (rows). Also, the tibble output shows you the first ten rows. Alternatively you can inspect the data with the help of str() or tibble::glimpse() to print a transposed version. 3.2.4 Data types If you have looked carefully, you may have noticed that a tibble prints also the data type of each column, e.g. &lt;chr&gt;. In our case, we have specified the types of the columns manually when importing the data; if not specified, readr::read_csv() as most other import functions will guess the data type for each column based on the first x observations. The data encoding is especially important when exploring chart options and writing ggplot code. You should be familiar if the data is encoded as quantitative or qualitative, if it contains missing or unusual values. Thus, it is always worth to check the classes and the values of the columns. In R there are multiple low-level data types, and some of the ggplot2 behavior will depend on the type of the variable(s) used for plotting. The six basic data types are: character factor numeric integer logical complex To examine the data type of an object, use the class() function. The $ symbol allows you to access single columns of a data frame, e.g. bikes$day_night: class(bikes$day_night) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(bikes$weather_type) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; class(bikes$temp) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(bikes$count) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; class(bikes$is_weekend) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Variables of type character, factor, and logical will be handled as categorical, qualitative data while numeric, integer, and complex6 are treated as numerical, quantitative data. The most important difference between the categorical types is their sorting: while character and also logical values are sorted alphabetically, factor variables have a specified order, defined by the so-called levels. Note that numbers can be treated as categorical as well and thus we can change their intrinsic order, too. We can inspect the order with the levels(): levels(bikes$weather_type) ## an example of a factor with strings ## [1] &quot;broken clouds&quot; &quot;clear&quot; ## [3] &quot;cloudy&quot; &quot;scattered clouds&quot; ## [5] &quot;rain&quot; &quot;snowfall&quot; levels(bikes$season) ## an example of a factor with numbers ## [1] &quot;3&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; Also, we can manually change the order of a factor by supplying a vector of level names to the factor() function: bikes$season_mix &lt;- factor(bikes$season, levels = c(&quot;2&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;1&quot;)) levels(bikes$season_mix) ## [1] &quot;2&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;1&quot; The forcats package (Wickham 2022) provides a set of useful functions to reorder factor levels. Important functions to quickly change to order of variables include fct_rev(), fct_reorder(), fct_infreq(), fct_inorder(), and fct_lump(): bikes$weather_type_rev &lt;- forcats::fct_rev(bikes$weather_type) levels(bikes$weather_type_rev) ## [1] &quot;snowfall&quot; &quot;rain&quot; ## [3] &quot;scattered clouds&quot; &quot;cloudy&quot; ## [5] &quot;clear&quot; &quot;broken clouds&quot; bikes$weather_type_rank &lt;- forcats::fct_infreq(bikes$weather_type) levels(bikes$weather_type_rank) ## [1] &quot;clear&quot; &quot;scattered clouds&quot; ## [3] &quot;broken clouds&quot; &quot;rain&quot; ## [5] &quot;cloudy&quot; &quot;snowfall&quot; The single difference between the two numerical types numeric and integer is simply-speaking the existence of floating point numbers: while numeric variables store decimals, integer variables are stored as whole numbers. If you want to force integer values, you can specify them as 1L. head(bikes$temp) ## numeric ## [1] 2.167 2.792 8.958 7.125 9.000 6.708 as.integer(head(bikes$temp)) ## integer ## [1] 2 2 8 7 9 6 As shown in the last command, we can also convert data types. Be careful though, as R has internal rules how to coerce one data type into another. The same also happens if you specify a vector of multiple data types. In the following example, the integer, numeric, and logical values are coerced to character values. Afterwards, we explore the coercion behavior by converting the vector to other data types: my_vector &lt;- c(1L, 0.2, &quot;ggplot&quot;, FALSE) my_vector ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;0.2&quot; &quot;ggplot&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; class(my_vector) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; as.numeric(my_vector) ## [1] 1.0 0.2 NA NA as.integer(my_vector) ## [1] 1 0 NA NA as.factor(my_vector) ## [1] 1 0.2 ggplot FALSE ## Levels: 0.2 1 FALSE ggplot as.logical(my_vector) ## [1] NA NA NA FALSE When changing the data type of our character vector, some values are successfully converted (e.g. 1L and 0.2 as numeric or FALSE as logical) while some are “wrongly” interpreted (e.g. 0.2 is converted into 0L as integer or FALSE into \"FALSE\" as character). Some others are stored as NA representing unknown, not available values (e.g. \"ggplot\" as numeric or 1 as logical). Conversion between different data types is very useful but be careful and always inspect the output of the conversion for potential coercion mistakes. Another important data type is the Date class. Dates are either represented as the number of days since a specified origin or converted character type with a structure of YYYY-MM-DD: class(bikes$date) ## [1] &quot;Date&quot; as.Date(1, origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;) ## [1] &quot;1970-01-02&quot; as.Date(&quot;2007-06-10&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2007-06-10&quot; as.Date(&quot;2022-09-16&quot;) - as.Date(&quot;2007-06-10&quot;) ## Time difference of 5577 days Furthermore, POSIXct and POSIXlt are able to represent full time stamps including a date and time. The two POSIX date/time classes only differ in the way that the values are stored internally. as.POSIXct(&quot;2007-06-10 12:34:56&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2007-06-10 12:34:56 CEST&quot; as.POSIXlt(&quot;2007-06-10 12:34:56&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2007-06-10 12:34:56 CEST&quot; 3.2.5 Data preparation Often, the data imported might not be in the right format to plot it with ggplot2. The preparation of the data—e.g. converting data types and setting factor levels, aggregating values, estimating data summaries, reshaping the data set or combining it with another source—is called data wrangling, data munging, or data manipulation. To explore and retrieve summary estimates of individual variables, the following functions are useful: min(), max(), range() to extract extremes of numerical data quantile() to get an idea of the distribution numerical data unique() to get all unique entries, helpful for categorical data length(unique()) to count all unique entries min(bikes$temp) ## add na.rm = TRUE in case it returns `NA` ## [1] 0.125 range(bikes$date) ## [1] &quot;2015-01-04&quot; &quot;2016-12-31&quot; quantile(bikes$count) ## 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% ## 953 7508 11965 19412 51870 unique(bikes$day_night) ## [1] &quot;day&quot; &quot;night&quot; length(unique(bikes$weather_type)) ## [1] 6 The dplyr (Wickham et al. 2022) and other tidyverse packages provide a simple and intuitive syntax to wrangle data. There are a ton of unique functions, but knowing a handful is enough to empower you to bring your data in the right format. 3.2.5.1 Data wrangling with the {dplyr} package There are five main functions of dplyr, called verbs: filter(): Pick rows with matching criteria select(): Pick columns with matching criteria arrange(): Reorder rows mutate(): Create new variables summarize() or summarise(): Sum up variables All of these functions follow a consistent syntax: verb(data, condition). Note that we specify the data and columns individually and that within the tidyverse, column names are referred to without quotation marks: ## load the package functions library(dplyr) ## only keep more than 1000 shares during the night filter(bikes, day_night == &quot;night&quot;, count &gt; 1000) ## only keep 4 columns and reorder those select(bikes, date, count, weather_type, temp) ## order by day_night and decreasing bike shares arrange(bikes, day_night, -count) ## add a column with temperature encoded as °F mutate(bikes, temp_fahrenheit = temp * 1.8 + 32) ## calculate the mean count across all observations summarize(bikes, count_avg = mean(count)) Another important and very powerful function from the dplyr package is group_by(): when a data set is grouped into subsets, we can apply any operation for each group within a single data frame. While you could nest those functions, the common approach within the tidyverse is the use of pipes. Pipes take the output of one function and send it directly to the next which avoids nested operations and allows for a more logical order of functions and their arguments. The tidyverse pipe is encoded as %&gt;%; a base R pipe is available as |&gt; as well. Have a look at the following silly example: ## nested functions, read inside out + disconnected function inputs go_to_work( breakfast( wake_up( Cedric, alarm = &quot;06:30&quot;) ), c(&quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;croissant&quot;) ), mode = &quot;bus&quot;, delay = 10 ) ## piped version with &quot;Cedric&quot; passed to the next function call Cedric %&gt;% wake_up(alarm = &quot;06:30&quot;)) %&gt;% breakfast(c(&quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;croissant&quot;) %&gt;% go_to_work(mode = &quot;bus&quot;, delay = 10) Let’s create the workflow for some serious data preparation: In a first step, we are going to estimate the average temperature for night rents per year and season: bikes_summarized &lt;- bikes %&gt;% ## only keep night observations filter(day_night == &quot;night&quot;) %&gt;% ## create 8 subsets (4 seasons x 2 years) group_by(season, year) %&gt;% ## calculate total counts and mean temperature per subgroup summarize( count = sum(count), temp_avg = mean(temp) ) bikes_summarized ## # A tibble: 8 × 4 ## # Groups: season [4] ## season year count temp_avg ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 2015 459469 7.65 ## 2 3 2016 489136 6.91 ## 3 0 2015 693703 9.93 ## 4 0 2016 676427 9.43 ## 5 1 2015 1020524 17.2 ## 6 1 2016 1044592 17.7 ## 7 2 2015 685534 12.4 ## 8 2 2016 744827 12.3 After filtering out “day” cases, the grouping by season and year allows us to summarize counts and average temperatures for each of the eight groups. Note that the resulting tibble is still grouped by season (as shown in the output with the [4] explicitly stating the number of current subsets). In a next step, we regroup our data to add a column with shares of nightly bike rents per season on a yearly basis. Afterwards, we remove all subsets by calling ungroup() and clean our data set by reordering and removing columns and sorting rows by year and season: bikes_summarized %&gt;% ## add column with relative shares per year group_by(year) %&gt;% mutate(share_year = count / sum(count)) %&gt;% ## remove grouping ungroup() %&gt;% ## reorder columns and remove days column select(year, season, count, share_year, temp_avg) %&gt;% ## sort by year and season arrange(year, season) ## # A tibble: 8 × 5 ## year season count share_year temp_avg ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2015 3 459469 0.161 7.65 ## 2 2015 0 693703 0.243 9.93 ## 3 2015 1 1020524 0.357 17.2 ## 4 2015 2 685534 0.240 12.4 ## 5 2016 3 489136 0.166 6.91 ## 6 2016 0 676427 0.229 9.43 ## 7 2016 1 1044592 0.354 17.7 ## 8 2016 2 744827 0.252 12.3 3.2.5.2 Reshaping data with the {tidyr} package In case you need to reshape a data set to make it work with ggplot2, you can use the functions pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() from the tidyr package (Wickham and Girlich 2022) to move from one format to the other. Let’s illustrate their behavior using one of the toy data sets used in section ## create long-format data as showcased in section 2 data_long &lt;- tibble::tibble( group = rep(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), 4), year = rep(rep(c(&quot;2022&quot;, &quot;2023&quot;), each = 3), 2), metric = c(rep(&quot;x&quot;, 6), rep(&quot;y&quot;, 6)), value = c(46, 2, 21, 32, 16, 7, 12, 35, 24, 1, 42, 27) ) ## print long-format data head(data_long, 5) ## # A tibble: 5 × 4 ## group year metric value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 A 2022 x 46 ## 2 B 2022 x 2 ## 3 C 2022 x 21 ## 4 A 2023 x 32 ## 5 B 2023 x 16 ## turn long-format data into wide-format data data_wide &lt;- tidyr::pivot_wider( data = data_long, ## the long data set names_from = metric, ## new column names values_from = value, ## values to be filled in names_prefix = &quot;metric_&quot; ## adjust new column names ) ## print wide-format data data_wide ## # A tibble: 6 × 4 ## group year metric_x metric_y ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 A 2022 46 12 ## 2 B 2022 2 35 ## 3 C 2022 21 24 ## 4 A 2023 32 1 ## 5 B 2023 16 42 ## 6 C 2023 7 27 ## turn wide-format data back to long-format data data_long_again &lt;- tidyr::pivot_longer( data = data_wide, ## the wide data set cols = c(metric_x, metric_y), ## columns to pivot names_to = &quot;metric&quot;, ## column to hold variable values_to = &quot;value&quot;, ## column to hold values names_prefix = &quot;metric_&quot; ## adjust new variable names ) [WIP] lubridate, stringr, … References "],["walkthrough.html", "Chapter 4 A Walk-through Example 4.1 Prerequisites 4.2 Create a basic ggplot 4.3 Combine multiple layers 4.4 Mapping aesthetics in layers 4.5 Setting properties in layers 4.6 Create small multiples 4.7 Change the axis scaling 4.8 Use a custom color palette 4.9 Adjust labels 4.10 Apply a complete theme 4.11 Customize the theme", " Chapter 4 A Walk-through Example To illustrate the utility and flexibility of ggplot2 to create complex, well-designed visualizations with a handful of components, we are going to create a set of four plots. For each combination of year and time of the day, we draw a scatter plot of bike rents including a linear fitting to show overall trends with feels-like temperature. The creation of the plot itself will require only four lines of code! One to specify the data and global aesthetics, two for the scatter and fitting, and another one to create small multiples. With a few more lines of code, we will adjust the labels, add annotations, and apply a custom color palette. Finally, we apply a personalized theme using custom typefaces. 4.1 Prerequisites Before we can create a ggplot, we have to load the package by running library(ggplot2). Also, we need import the data set we want to visualize, here our bike share data introduced in Section 3.1 which we store in an object called bikes. ## load the ggplot2 package library(ggplot2) ## import bikes data set url_data &lt;- &quot;https://cedricscherer.com/data/london-bikes.csv&quot; bikes &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = url_data, col_types = &quot;Dcfffilllddddfc&quot;) 4.2 Create a basic ggplot Once the ggplot2 package is loaded, we can create a basic ggplot by specifying the data, aesthetics—the positional encoding of the variables—, and a geometry. Here, we map the variable temp_feel of our bikes data object to the x position and the variable count to the y position (4.1). We will also map variables to all kind of other aesthetics throughout the book. Some are related to positions such as xmin or yend while others change the appearance of the layer based on the variables they are mapped to such as color and shape. There are many, many different geometries (often called geoms because each function starts with geom_) one can add to a ggplot by default and even more provided by extension packages. By adding geom_point() we create a scatter plot: ggplot(data = bikes) + ## initial call + data aes(x = temp_feel, y = count) + ## aesthetics geom_point() ## geometric layer FIGURE 4.1: A basic scatter plot of feels-like temperature and reported TfL bike rents, created with the {ggplot2} package. In most cases, you will find ggplot code in which the aesthetics are supplied inside the ggplot() call; however, both versions are valid. ggplot(data = bikes, mapping = aes(x = temp_feel, y = count)) + geom_point() Due to so-called implicit matching, we can rewrite the first part as ggplot(bikes, aes(date, count)), omitting the argument names data and mapping in the ggplot() call and x and y in the aes() function. This works as long as we respect the defined order. Omitting the arguments data and mapping saves you a ton of typing when creating dozens to hundreds ggplots per day. In my opinion, it is good practice to refer to aesthetics explicitly, and I will follow this convention throughout the book. 4.3 Combine multiple layers One can also add several layers, specified as either geometric shapes starting with geom*() or statistical transformations starting with stat_*() (4.2)—and this is where the magic and fun starts! ggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = count)) + geom_point() + ## add a GAM smoothing stat_smooth() FIGURE 4.2: The same scatter plot, now with an additional GAM smoothing. Both geom_*() and stat_*() internally make use of the same function layer() and pass default inputs for the geom, stat, and position arguments. Basically the use of geoms versus stats is only the perspective and personal preference: when specifying geom_*() we focus on the shape representing the variables; using stat_*() highlights the transformation applied to the variables. More information on the different geometries is provided in Chapter XYZ and a deep-dive into the power of statistical transformation is Chapter XYZ. 4.4 Mapping aesthetics in layers By looking at these scatter plots, we can actually identify two different trends for day and night. We can highlight both groups by mapping the day_night variable to color (Fig. 4.3). Note that the mapping is applied to both, geom_point() and geom_smooth() and consequently the latter layer creates two separate smoothings. ggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = count, color = day_night)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth() FIGURE 4.3: The points and smoothing lines colored by the time of the day. Aesthetics can also be defined for each layer and are then applied locally to the respective geometry or statistical transformation only. The group aesthetics allows to create subsets without changing the visual appearance (in contrast to aesthetics such as color or shape). You will learn more how to work with global and local aesthetics in Chapter XYZ and how to modify their appearance in Chapter XYZ. 4.5 Setting properties in layers Furthermore, each layer has its own arguments to change their behavior and appearance. Let’s also add some transparency to the points and turn the smoothing into a linear fitting (Fig. 4.4). As we are not mapping aesthetics but setting properties, we have to place those adjustments outside the aes() call. ggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = count)) + geom_point( ## color mapping only applied to points aes(color = day_night), ## setting larger points with 50% opacity alpha = .5, size = 2 ) + stat_smooth( ## invisible grouping to create two trend lines aes(group = day_night), ## use linear fitting + black smoothing lines method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) FIGURE 4.4: We can map aesthetics and define properties for each layer individually. In general follow the rule to set constant properties outside aes() and map variables to aesthetics inside aes(). The different aesthetics and the differences of global versus local mapping of aesthetics is explained in Chapter XYZ. 4.6 Create small multiples A fantastic feature of ggplot2 is it’s ability to quickly split a single visualization in a set of so-called small multiples: the same visualization, no matter how complex it is, is applied to subsets contained in the same data set. In ggplot2, such small multiples are called facets wich are conditional on the variables defined in the facet_*() function (Fig. 4.5). ggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = count)) + geom_point( aes(color = day_night), alpha = .5, size = 2 ) + stat_smooth( aes(group = day_night), method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) + ## small multiples based on time of the day (rows) and year (columns) facet_grid(day_night ~ year) FIGURE 4.5: With the facet functions, a visualization can quickly be split into small multiples. Consistency across axes is considered good practice as varying axis ranges are harder to compare and the potential of misleading viewers increases in case the differences keep unnoticed—or even worse are not noticeable. The implementation of facet in ggplot2 ensures consistency across all small multiples by default, as illustrated by the empty space in the lower row as there are no values above ~21,000 reported rents during night. The facet functionality also comes with the option to overwrite the default behavior by “freeing” the positional scales. Furthermore, one can ensure equal axis spacing by freeing the space as well (Fig. 4.6). This setting allows to efficiently use the available space while ensuring comparability across plots and decreasing the potential of misleading the viewer. The differences between the two ways to create small multiples, namely facet_grid() and facet_wrap(), as well as ways to adjust and annotate facets are explained in Chapter XYZ. ggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = count)) + geom_point( aes(color = day_night), alpha = .5, size = 2 ) + stat_smooth( aes(group = day_night), method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) + facet_grid( ## free y axis range + scale heights respectively day_night ~ year, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, space = &quot;free_y&quot; ) FIGURE 4.6: {ggplot2} even allows to free the axis range—while ensuring equal axis spacing. 4.7 Change the axis scaling For every aesthetic, ggplot2 applies so-called scales that translate between variable ranges (data) and property ranges (aesthetic). For the positional axes, a set of scale_x_*() and scale_y_*() controls their behavior. The breaks argument defines the placement of the axes ticks while the labels argument controls the labels next to those ticks. The labels can be either overwritten by a vector of the same length as the breaks (as for x in our example) or a function that returns a vector based on the breaks (as for y in our example). There are many more arguments such as expand to control the padding towards the ends of the respective axis or trans to transform the scale. You can read more about how to control scales in Chapter XYZ and about label adjustment and styling in Chapter XYZ. ggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = count)) + geom_point( aes(color = season), alpha = .5, size = 2 ) + stat_smooth( aes(group = day_night), method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) + facet_grid( day_night ~ year, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, space = &quot;free_y&quot; ) + ## x axis: add °C symbol + 5°C spacing scale_x_continuous( breaks = -1:6*5, labels = function(x) paste0(x, &quot;°C&quot;), expand = c(mult = 0, add = 1) ) + ## y axis: add a thousand separator + consistent spacing across rows scale_y_continuous( breaks = 0:5*10000, labels = scales::label_comma(), expand = c(mult = .1, add = 0) ) FIGURE 4.7: To adjust the formatting of axis labels, the respective axis needs to be addressed via the scale_*() functions. 4.8 Use a custom color palette The scales do not only control the behavior of the axes but also all other aesthetics such as color, shape or alpha. In case of categorical colors, scale_color_manual() enables us to overwrite the default color set by passing a vector of colors. g1 &lt;- ggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = count)) + geom_point( aes(color = season), alpha = .5, size = 2 ) + stat_smooth( aes(group = day_night), method = &quot;lm&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot; ) + facet_grid( day_night ~ year, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, space = &quot;free_y&quot; ) + scale_x_continuous( breaks = -1:6*5, labels = function(x) paste0(x, &quot;°C&quot;), expand = c(mult = 0, add = 1) ) + scale_y_continuous( breaks = 0:5*10000, labels = scales::label_comma(), expand = c(mult = .1, add = 0) ) + ## use a custom color palette for season colors scale_color_manual( values = c(&quot;#3c89d9&quot;, &quot;#1ec99b&quot;, &quot;#F7B01B&quot;, &quot;#a26e7c&quot;) ) g1 The colors will be applied in order, i.e. the levels of the factor or alphabetical in case of character variables. To ensure correct mapping, one can also use a named vector. You will learn more about the different color and fill scales and how to manipulate colors in Chapter XYZ. The chapter also features an example how to create a corporate color or fill scale to ensure consistent color use. Furthermore, we are storing the current plot in an object named g1. This ggplot object can be extended afterwards. Storing intermediate ggplot outputs is especially helpful if the code becomes rather long and in case you have multiple variants of the same chart, for example when building up a chart stepwise. Another common use case is the creation of graphics in multiple languages. 4.9 Adjust labels For now, we have ignored that ggplot2 uses the variable names as specified in our bikes object for data-related labels. Resist the temptation to change the variable names in your original data set! We can easily overwrite those by referring to the respective aesthetic (x, y, and color) in the labs() function which we add to our plot. Here, we can also specify a title, subtitle, caption, and tag (subtitle and tag are not shown in the following example; Fig. 4.8). g2 &lt;- g1 + labs( ## overwrite axis and legend titles x = &quot;Average Feels-Like Temperature&quot;, y = NULL, color = NULL, ## add plot title and caption title = &quot;Trends of reported bike rents versus feels-like temperature in London.&quot;, caption = &quot;Data: TfL (Transport for London), Jan 2015–Dec 2016&quot; ) g2 FIGURE 4.8: We can overwrite the default labels with the labs() which also allows to add a title, subtitle, caption, and tag to the graphic. Let’s also overwrite the cryptic numeric encoding of the seasons. Similar to the positional scales, we can pass a vector or function to the labels argument in the scale_color_*() component: g3 &lt;- g2 + scale_color_manual( values = c(&quot;#3c89d9&quot;, &quot;#1ec99b&quot;, &quot;#F7B01B&quot;, &quot;#a26e7c&quot;), labels = c(&quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot;, &quot;Autumn&quot;) ) g3 FIGURE 4.9: By passing a vector of the same length as there are seasons to the labels argument of the scale_color_*() function, we can overwrite the labels used in the legend. Note that the code is returning a message informing you that the present color scale has been replaced. As you can only apply one scale per aesthetic, we also have to pass the color vector again to use the custom colors from before. 4.10 Apply a complete theme ggplot2 comes with a set of so-called complete themes. We can add one of these to overwrite the default theme_grey() by one of the others (run ?theme_grey for a full list of available complete themes). When adding a theme to a ggplot, we can already overwrite the base_size of the theme elements, which translates to the size of text labels and line widths. Furthermore, we can set a non-default typeface by supplying a locally installed typeface in the base_family argument. g3 + ## add theme with a custom font + larger element sizes theme_light( base_size = 12, base_family = &quot;Spline Sans&quot; ) FIGURE 4.10: The graphic now comes with a new look and a non-default font used for all text labels. 4.11 Customize the theme The complete themes follow a set of rules that overwrite the choices made for the default theme_grey(). By using a theme() call after (!) adding a complete theme, one can adjust the appearance of single elements (e.g. plot.title or panel.grid.major.x) as well as set some pre-set options such as the positions of titles, captions and legends (plot.title.position, plot.caption.position and legend.position). In general, theme elements can be of class text (e.g. plot.title), line (e.g. panel.grid.major.x), or rectangle (e.g. panel.background). In addition, we can use element_blank() to remove an element entirely as set for panel.grid.minor in our example. g3 + theme_light( base_size = 12, base_family = &quot;Spline Sans&quot; ) + ## theme adjustments theme( plot.title.position = &quot;plot&quot;, ## left-align title plot.caption.position = &quot;plot&quot;, ## right-align title plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = rel(1.3)), ## larger bold title axis.text = element_text(family = &quot;Spline Sans Mono&quot;), ## monospaced font for axes axis.title.x = element_text( ## left-aligned, grey x axis label hjust = 0, color = &quot;grey30&quot;, margin = margin(t = 12) ), strip.text = element_text( ## larger bold facet labels face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = rel(1.15) ), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), ## no vertical grid lines panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), ## no minor grid lines legend.position = &quot;top&quot;, ## place legend above plot legend.text = element_text(size = rel(1)) ## larger legend labels ) FIGURE 4.11: After applying on of the complete themes, one can further style the theme to the personal needs. The book covers themes in full detail in Chapter XYZ. Here you learn how to leverage complete themes, which other complete themes are provided by extension packages, and how to create your own custom, corporate theme to apply a cohesive and easily reproducible style to all of your graphics.

First, let’s create a plot to work with: we will display the counts of reported bike rents during the night only as a time series. To focus on the tips, we assign the ggplot output to g and extend this object in the following. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) bikes_nightly &lt;- filter(bikes, day_night == &quot;night&quot;) g &lt;- ggplot(bikes_nightly, aes(x = date, y = count)) + geom_point(aes(color = temp), alpha = .5) + ## style y axis, labels and colors scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), labels = scales::label_comma()) + scale_color_gradient( low = &quot;#00B3FF&quot;, high = &quot;#FF5477&quot;, labels = scales::label_number(suffix = &quot;°C&quot;) ) + labs( x = NULL, y = &quot;Number of bike rents per night&quot;, color = &quot;Average Temperature:&quot;, title = &quot;TfL bike rents peak during warm summer nights&quot;, subtitle = &quot;A time series of reported bike rents between 6 pm and 6 am in London&quot;, caption = &quot;Data: TfL (Transport for London), Jan 2015–Dec 2016&quot; ) g FIGURE 5.1: A time series of reported bike rents during the night (6 pm to 6 am) with points being encoded by the average temperature using the default ggplot2 theme. 5.1 Use a Different Theme The simplest step to give your plot a different appearance is using one of the complete themes provided by ggplot2. We already have seen theme_light() in the previous section. A full list of themes: theme_gray(), the default theme with a grey panel, white grid lines, and grey boxes for facets theme_minimal() without a panel border and facet boxes ≈* theme_bw() with a white panel, grey grid lines, a black panel border, and grey boxes for facets theme_linedraw(), similar to theme_bw() but featuring black axis text and facet boxes theme_light(), similar to theme_bw() but with a grey panel border and all-grey facet boxes theme_minimal() without a panel border and facet boxes theme_classic() with axis lines but no grid lines and white facet boxes with a black outline theme_dark() with a dark-grey panel and even darker facet boxes theme_void(), a completely empty theme The completely empty theme theme_void() is often helpful when working with maps. Also, you can use it to build your theme element by element like drawing on a blank canvas. Let’s use the popular theme_minimal() for now: g + theme_minimal() FIGURE 5.2: The same plot as before using the minimal theme. 5.2 Use a Custom Font There are multiple extension packages that aim to provide access to font files, extrafont, sysfont, showtext, and systemfonts to name a few. To my knowledge, the systemfonts package provides the best solution to work with typefaces and resolve font specifications. After loading the package, all locally installed font files are available in your current R session. The default font family of ggplot themes is the default sans serif font and thus it is specific to the system you and potential collaborators are working on. You can overwrite the default by passing a font family as argument to base_family inside the theme_*() call. g + theme_minimal(base_family = &quot;Asap Condensed&quot;) FIGURE 5.3: All text labels now use a custom font by changing the base_family of the theme. If you are searching for a specific font, this is my script to return family names that can be used as inputs for text elements in ggplot2: systemfonts::system_fonts() %&gt;% ## filter for a pattern dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(name, &quot;Asap&quot;)) %&gt;% ## only keep family column dplyr::pull(family) %&gt;% ## only keep distinct families and sort them by name unique() %&gt;% sort() ## [1] &quot;Asap&quot; &quot;Asap Condensed&quot; ## [3] &quot;Asap Expanded&quot; &quot;Asap SemiCondensed&quot; ## [5] &quot;Asap SemiExpanded&quot; 5.3 Increase the Font Sizes The base size in any ggplot theme is set to 11. This number determines the individual text sizes and line widths of your theme elements. Depending on the width and height specified when saving your plot, you may want to adjust the overall size by changing the base_size in the theme_*() call. (g &lt;- g + theme_minimal(base_family = &quot;Asap Condensed&quot;, base_size = 14)) FIGURE 5.4: If the text elements are too small for the desired out width and height, you can adjust them by overwriting the default base_size. 5.4 Create Text Hierarchy By default, the title is always set in regular weight. In many cases I find myself using a font that is bold and larger than by default. You can update details of the theme by directly addressing the respective theme element, here plot.title. As the title is a text element, we pass the new settings inside the element_text() function. The face argument controls the font style and can take \"regular\", \"bold\", \"italic\", and \"bold.italic\" as inputs. The size can either be set in absolute numbers or relative to the base_size via the rel() function. (g &lt;- g + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = rel(1.4)))) FIGURE 5.5: One can style single theme elements with the theme() function. Here, we create a more pronounced tet hierarchy by setting the title in a bigger, bold typeface. 5.5 Legend Styling [WIP] g + guides(color = guide_colorsteps()) g + guides(color = guide_colorsteps( barheight = unit(15, &quot;lines&quot;) )) g + guides(color = guide_colorsteps( barwidth = unit(25, &quot;lines&quot;), title.position = &quot;top&quot; )) + theme(legend.position = &quot;top&quot;, legend.justification = &quot;left&quot;) 5.6 Align Titles and Captions By default, the titles and captions are left-aligned with the horizontal justification being set to hjust = 0. However, the horizontal justification does only impact the alignment of the title relative to the panel. If you want to place these text elements relative to the outer border of your graphic. you can set plot.title.position plot.caption.position to \"plot\", respectively g + theme(plot.title.position = &quot;plot&quot;, plot.caption.position = &quot;plot&quot;) FIGURE 5.6: The title and sutitle can be aligned with the plot border by setting plot.title.position to \"plot\". Similarly, the position of the caption can be changed by using plot.caption.position. The importance of aligning the title either with the panel border (the default behavior) or with the plot border becomes especially important if you have long labels on the left of the plot. This is often the case when displaying categories along the y axis with a left-aligned title (Fig. 5.7. The same applies for right-aligned text in case of increased margins on the right of the panel, for example when using facets or adding legends. FIGURE 5.7: Plots with long labels on the y axis with the title being either aligned with the panel border (default behavior, left) or with the plot border (right). 5.7 Add Some White Space [WIP] g + theme(plot.margin = margin(rep(20, 4))) g + theme( plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(b = 10)), plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(b = 15)), plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 20)), axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)), legend.title = element_text(margin = margin(b = 10)), ) "],["tips-to-improve-your-ggplot-workflow.html", "Chapter 6 Tips to Improve Your ggplot Workflow 6.1 Save ggplot Output with the “Correct” Dimensions 6.2 Display ggplot Output with the “Correct” Dimensions 6.3 Make Fonts Work 6.4 Set Your ggplot Theme Globally 6.5 Create Your Own Theme 6.6 Improve Your ggplot Design 6.7 Remove Panel Padding 6.8 Legend Styling 6.9 Align Titles and Captions 6.10 Add Some White Space", " Chapter 6 Tips to Improve Your ggplot Workflow When designing graphics with a code-based software, changes in the code need to be rendered to a graphical output to see the actual changes. The process of saving the graphic successfully in the desired format and being able to quickly inspect the adjustments are often a main source of frustration. The first tips thus cover how-to’s on saving your ggplot output in the correct dimension, improving the iterative design process, and embedding non-default typefaces. A benefit of a code-based graphics software is the ability to automate steps to avoid redundant code and allow for consistency. By adjusting the default settings, reusing code or even writing your own helper functions and themes rather than typing the same code again and again enables one to work more efficiently while preventing mistakes and inconsistencies. 6.1 Save ggplot Output with the “Correct” Dimensions One of the most common question I hear is “how do I save the plot in a way that it looks as in the RStudio Plots pane?”. As the Plots pane in RStudio is responsive, it will redraw the plot with new dimensions every time you resize the pane. Consequently, the relative size of geometries and theme elements changes as well. Also, the dimensions of the plot shown are not obvious so you may end up in a loop of guessing the right measurements and adjusting the sizes, margins, widths of your components. For sure, the iteration of adjusting sizes and position is one of the most annoying and elaborate tasks when designing graphics with ggplot2. And most ggplot users will painfully remember the moment when a plot saved to disk looks absolutely nothing as it did in the Plots pane. So how can we avoid this time-consuming task? Don’t rely on the preview and decide on the dimensions before polishing: Once you are moving from exploring the data and potential visualizations to creating your final polished graphic, save the plot to disk in the desired width and height. By default, the dimensions are in inches. ggsave(&quot;plot.png&quot;, width = 12, height = 8) ggsave(&quot;plot.png&quot;, width = 30, height = 20, unit = &quot;cm&quot;) From now on, stick to this dimension and adjust the components after inspecting the saved graphic. Of course, you can adjust the dimensions afterwards. Slight changes will have no big impact on the relative sizes; otherwise, you may have to resize some of your components. If you are saving raster files such as .png and .jpeg, make sure to set the desired resolution by setting dpi. For web applications, images usually should be of low resolution to avoid long loading times (72 dpi is the general recommendation) while graphics used for print should be of high resolution of 300 dpi or more. The default in ggsave() is 300 dpi. 6.2 Display ggplot Output with the “Correct” Dimensions The iterative process of adjusting your graphic, saving it to disk, navigating to the folder, and looking at the plot is a tedious one. To avoid the additional workload, you can optimize your workflow by previewing your graphic in the correct dimensions without leaving RStudio. Work in Quarto (.qmd) or Rmarkdown (.rmd) files to inspect your plots in-line: In qmd and rmd formats, code is run inside individual chunks for which you can define figure dimensions by setting fig.width or fig.height as chunk options 7. ```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=8} ``` When a chunk is executed, the in-line plot output will respect these settings. When saving the file with ggsave(), make sure to use the same width and height. By default, the units in both chunk settings and ggsave() are in inches. Use the camcorder package to automatically save and display your graphics: The camcorder package (Hughes 2022) is an R package that automatically saves graphics generated with ggplot2 with custom settings. The package allows you to inspect the ggplot output directly in RStudio by displaying the saved graphic in the Viewer pane. As each graphic is saved automatically, running ggsave() after every adjustment becomes obsolote—another time-saver! You initiate a recoding by calling gg_record() with the desired path to save the plots to and image settings as you specify them in ggsave(): install.packages(&quot;camcorder&quot;) camcorder::gg_record( dir = &quot;./plots&quot;, ## where to save the recording device = &quot;png&quot;, ## device to use to save images width = 12, ## width of saved image height = 8, ## height of saved image dpi = 300 ## dpi to use when saving image ) If you want to change some settings later, use gg_resize_film(): camcorder::gg_resize_film(width = 12.5) The original purpose of camcorder is the generation of a GIF that showcases every step of the design process using the saved image files. If you want to create such an animation, run gg_playback(): camcorder::gg_playback(name = &quot;./plots/process.gif&quot;) 6.3 Make Fonts Work Use the systemfonts package to find and use typefaces: As discussed in the previous chapter, the systemfonts package is likely the preferred approach to work with fonts. To search for a font file on your system use match_font(). You can inspect all available typefaces via system_fonts(). A common issue is the rendering of custom typefaces and special characters such as mathematical symbols, unusual glyphs, and emojis. If you are saving your graphics as PNG raster images use the agg_png device: The best-performing device to render your ggplot output successfully are the agg devices. In recent versions, this device is the default in ggsave() in case the ragg package is installed. It also features agg devices for other raster formats such as JPEG and TIFF. library(ragg) ggsave(&quot;plot.png&quot;, device = agg_png) To make fonts work in the RStudio Plots pane, select the AGG device as default for the graphics backend by navigating to Tools &gt; Global Options... &gt; General &gt; Graphics. If you are saving your graphics as PDF vector graphics use the cairo_pdf device: I prefer to dave my files as lossless vector graphics. The device known to work best for rendering is the Cairo device which needs to be secified as device = cairo_pdf. Mac users need to install XQuartz which is needed to use the Cairo device. ggsave(&quot;plot.pdf&quot;, device = cairo_pdf) 6.4 Set Your ggplot Theme Globally Instead of applying and customizing a theme for each of your ggplots, you can set your theme once and it will be used for all future ggplot output by passing a complete theme to theme_set(). theme_set(theme_minimal()) Let’s see how a plot using theme_minimal() looks like—note that we do not apply the theme to the plot itself. g &lt;- ggplot(bikes, aes(x = humidity, y = count)) + geom_point(aes(color = day_night), alpha = .4) + ## style labels and colors scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;#9C4BFF&quot;, &quot;#00B3FF&quot;)) + labs( x = &quot;Humidity&quot;, y = &quot;Reported bike rents&quot;, color = NULL, title = &quot;Reported bike rents versus average humidity (day/night)&quot;, caption = &quot;Data: TfL (Transport for London), Jan 2015–Dec 2016&quot; ) g Furthermore, you can customize the new default theme supplied to theme_set(): Set the typeface for text elements and sizes of the theme elements when calling the complete theme. Adjust theme elements and components of the complete theme via theme_update(). theme_set( theme_minimal(base_family = &quot;Asap Condensed&quot;, base_size = 15) ) theme_update( panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;), plot.caption = element_text(color = &quot;grey40&quot;) ) [WIP] g FIGURE 6.1: Running the same plot with updated theme defaults, globally set via theme_update().

First, let’s create a plot to work with: we will display the counts of reported bike rents during the night only as a time series. To focus on the tips, we assign the ggplot output to g and extend this object in the following. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) bikes_nightly &lt;- filter(bikes, day_night == &quot;night&quot;) g &lt;- ggplot(bikes_nightly, aes(x = date, y = count)) + geom_point(aes(color = temp), alpha = .5) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) + scale_color_gradient( low = &quot;#00B3FF&quot;, high = &quot;#FF5477&quot;, labels = scales::label_number(suffix = &quot;°C&quot;) ) + labs( x = NULL, y = &quot;Number of bike rents per night&quot;, color = &quot;Average Temperature:&quot;, title = &quot;TfL bike rents peak during warm summer nights&quot;, caption = &quot;Data: TfL (Transport for London), Jan 2015–Dec 2016&quot; ) g 6.7 Remove Panel Padding g + coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE) g + coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE, clip = &quot;off&quot;) 6.8 Legend Styling g + guides(color = guide_colorsteps()) g + guides(color = guide_colorsteps( barwidth = unit(25, &quot;lines&quot;), title.position = &quot;top&quot; )) + theme(legend.position = &quot;top&quot;, legend.justification = &quot;left&quot;) 6.9 Align Titles and Captions By default, the titles and captions are left-aligned with the horizontal justification being set to hjust = 0. However, the horizontal justification does only impact the alignment of the title relative to the panel. If you want to place these text elements relative to the outer border of your graphic. you can set plot.title.position plot.caption.position to \"plot\", respectively g + theme(plot.title.position = &quot;plot&quot;, plot.caption.position = &quot;plot&quot;) The importance of aligning the title either with the panel border (the default behavior) or with the plot border becomes especially important if you have long labels on the left of the plot. This is often the case when displaying categories along the y axis with a left-aligned title (Fig. 6.4. The same applies for right-aligned text in case of increased margins on the right of the panel, for example when using facets or adding legends. FIGURE 6.4: Plots with long labels on the y axis with the title being either aligned with the panel border (default behavior, left) or with the plot border (right). 6.10 Add Some White Space g + theme(plot.margin = margin(rep(20, 4))) g + theme( plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(b = 15)), plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 20)), axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)), legend.title = element_text(margin = margin(b = 10)), ) References "],["working-with-layers.html", "Chapter 7 Working with Layers 7.1 Geometrical Shapes 7.2 Statistical Transformations 7.3 Positional Adjustments", " Chapter 7 Working with Layers Internally all layers are created by the layer() function.
