## The Data Set {#dataset}

We are using historical data for bike sharing in London in 2015 and 2016, provided by [*TfL (Transport for London)*](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles). The data was collected from the TfL data base and is 'Powered by TfL Open Data'. The processed data set contains hourly information on the number of rented bikes and was combined with weather data acquired from freemeteo.com. The data was contributed to the [Kaggle online community](https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset) by Hristo Mavrodiev.

```{r 03imgDataComparison, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The original and aggregated data sets in direct comparison: counts of bike shares registered by TfL over time  with month encoded by colour. The left panel shows counts for every hour of the day, while in the right panel the hourly data was aggregated into two periods of the day (day and night)."}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/setup-data-comparison-raw-aggregated.png", dpi = NA)
```

To make the visualizations manageable and patterns more insightful, we are using a modified data set with all variables aggregated for day (6:00am--5:59pm) and night (6:00pm--5:59am) (\@ref(fig:imgDataComparison)). The bike counts were summarized while all weather-related variables where averaged. Finally, for the weather type, the most common was used and, in case of a tie, one of the most common types was randomly chosen. The modified data sets contains 14 variables (columns) with 1,454 observations (rows). To give you a better idea what the data set contains, a visual overview of the variables is provided in table \@ref(tab:tableBikesData) and figure \@ref(fig:imgDataOverviewVars).

## Working in R {#rstats}

**{ggplot2}** can be used even if you know little about the R programming language. However, the knowledge of certain basic principles is at least helpful and probably indispensable for advanced plots. This section will give you a short overview of workflows and the very basics needed. The overview makes use of the **{tidyverse}**, a package collection designed for data science in R. However, multiple other options exist to import, inspect, and wrangle your data if you prefer not to work with the **{tidyverse}** for these steps[^02-get-started-1].

[^02-get-started-1]: Note that the **{ggplot2}** package itself belongs to the **{tidyverse}** as well.


### Import data {#import}

You need to import data to be able to work with it in the current session. The data can be imported from a local directory or directly from a web source. Nowadays, all common and some less common data formats can easily be imported. For common tabular data formats such as .txt or .csv one can use the [**{readr}** package](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) [@readr] from the **{tidyverse}**.

We use the `read_csv()` function to load the TfL data as .csv file directly from a web URL. To access the URL and data later, we are storing the link as `url_data` and the data set as `bikes` by using the *assignment arrow* `<-`. The `col_types` argument within the `read_csv()` function allows to specify the column types. For example, `i` represents integer values, `f` encodes factors, and `l` turns a column into a logical, boolean variable that only can have two states, `TRUE` or `FALSE`. You'll find more on the different *data types* later in this chapter.

```{r 03dataImportURL, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
url_data <- "https://cedricscherer.com/data/london-bikes.csv"
bikes <- readr::read_csv(file = url_data, col_types = "Dcfffilllddddfc")
```

<p class="note">

The `::` is called "namespace" and can be used to access a function without loading the package. Here, you could also run `library(readr)` first and `bikes <- read_csv(url_data)` afterwards.

</p>

If you want to load data that is stored locally, you specify the path to the file instead:

```{r 03dataImportLocal, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
path_data <- "C://path/to/my/data/london-bikes.csv" ## mocked-up name for Win users
bikes <- readr::read_csv(file = path_data, col_types = "Dcfffilllddddfc")
```

Note that the syntax of the path differs between operating systems. While in Windows subdirectories are separated with backslashes, Mac and Linux uses slashes. Also, absolute paths differ in their syntax: Windows machines specify the drive letter, here`C://`, or the server name; on Mac/Linux machines absolute paths start with `/users/`.

Instead of relying on the absolute path, which likely differs between users and operating systems, you can also use relative paths. Those are specified with a leading dot, e.g. as `./data/london-bikes.csv`, and look for the file relative from the working directory. You can retrieve and change your working directory with `getwd()` and `setwd()`. However, relying on the default working directory or setting a custom one will likely cause problems the moment someone else wants to run your code[^02-get-started-2].

[^02-get-started-2]: A detailed reasoning why you should not use `setwd()` is provided in [Chapter 2 of "What they forgot you to teach about R"](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html).

### Project-oriented workflows {#workflows}

Preferably, we do not want to rely on absolute paths and the default or manually set working directories. So-called project-oriented workflows aim to organize each piece of work in a self-contained, bundled directory. This directory includes all relevant files needed for the project, such as scripts and images. By ensuring that paths are set relative and in a way that they are understood by any operating system, we guarantee that the project will run on any machine and can easily moved around.

If you are working in Rstudio, *Rstudio projects* provide such a project-oriented workflow. When opening the project via the associated `.Rproj` file, it ensures that the working directory is correctly set and points to the project's top-level directory (i.e. the folder that contains the `.Rproj` file).

When using Rstudio projects, a helpful package to navigate to files of interest is the [**{here}** package](https://here.r-lib.org/). The function `here()` will create paths relative to the top-level directory:

```{r 03herePackage}
## point to the csv inside the "data" subdirectory of the project directory
path_data <- here::here("data", "london-bikes.csv") 
```


### Inspect data {#inspect}

After importing the data, it is advisable to have a look at the data. Does the object stored in R match the dimensions of your original data file? Are the variables displayed correctly? You can print the data by simply running the name of the object, here `bikes`.

```{r 03printData}
bikes
```

As we have used the **{readr}** package, our data is stored as a *tibble* (class `tbl_df` and related) which is the **{tidyverse}** subclass of a traditional data frame (class `data.frame`). There are other data structures in R such as lists and matrices; however, in this book we are going to use only data frames, more precisely tibbles (besides spatial data formats in Chapter XYZ).

On the top of the output, you can directly see that our data set consists of `format(length(bikes), big.mark = ",")` variables (columns) frame with `r format(nrow(bikes), big.mark = ",")` observations (rows). Also, the tibble output shows you the first ten rows. Alternatively you can inspect the data with the help of `str()` or `tibble::glimpse()` to print a transposed version.


### Data types {#classes}

If you have looked carefully, you may have noticed that a tibble prints also the data type of each column, e.g. `<chr>`. In our case, we have specified the types of the columns manually when importing the data; if not specified, `readr::read_csv()` as most other import functions will guess the data type for each column based on the first x observations.

The data encoding is especially important when exploring chart options and writing ggplot code. You should be familiar if the data is encoded as quantitative or qualitative, if it contains missing or unusual values. Thus, it is always worth to check the classes and the values of the columns.

In R there are multiple low-level data types, and some of the **{ggplot2}** behavior will depend on the type of the variable(s) used for plotting. The six basic data types are:

-   character
-   factor
-   numeric
-   integer
-   logical
-   complex

To examine the data type of an object, use the `class()` function. The `$` symbol allows you to access single columns of a data frame, e.g. `bikes$day_night`:

```{r 03classCharacter, collapse=TRUE}
class(bikes$day_night)

class(bikes$weather_type)

class(bikes$temp)

class(bikes$count)

class(bikes$is_weekend)
```

Variables of type `character`, `factor`, and `logical` will be handled as **categorical, qualitative data** while `numeric`, `integer`, and `complex`[^02-get-started-3] are treated as **numerical, quantitative data**.

[^02-get-started-3]: As variables of type `complex` are rarely used in a data visualization context, we are going to ignore this data type.

The most important difference between the categorical types is their sorting: while `character` and also `logical` values are sorted alphabetically, `factor` variables have a specified order, defined by the so-called *levels*. Note that numbers can be treated as well and thus we can change their intrinsic order, too. We can inspect the order with the `levels()`:

```{r 03factors, collapse=TRUE}
levels(bikes$weather_type) ## an example of a factor with strings

levels(bikes$season) ## an example of a factor with numbers
```

Also, we can manually change the order of a factor by supplying a vector of level names to the `factor()` function:

```{r 03factorsChange, collapse=TRUE}
bikes$season_mix <- factor(bikes$season, levels = c("2", "0", "3", "1"))
levels(bikes$season_mix)
```

The [**{forcats}** package](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) [@forcats] provides a set of useful functions to reorder factor levels. Important functions to quickly change to order of variables include `fct_rev()`, `fct_reorder()`, `fct_infreq()`, `fct_inorder()`, and `fct_lump()`:

```{r 03factorsForcats, collapse=TRUE}
bikes$weather_type_rev <- forcats::fct_rev(bikes$weather_type)
levels(bikes$weather_type_rev)

bikes$weather_type_rank <- forcats::fct_infreq(bikes$weather_type)
levels(bikes$weather_type_rank)
```

The single difference between the two numerical types `numeric` and `integer` is simply-speaking the existence of floating point numbers: while `numeric` variables store decimals, `integer` variables are stored as whole numbers. If you want to force integer values, you can specify them as `1L`.

```{r 03classesNumerical, collapse=TRUE}
head(bikes$temp) ## numeric

as.integer(head(bikes$temp)) ## integer
```

As shown in the last command, we can also convert data types. Be careful though, as R has internal rules how to *coerce* one data type into another. The same also happens if you specify a vector of multiple data types. In the following example, the `integer`, `numeric`, and `logical` values are coerced to `character` values. Afterwards, we explore the coercion behavior by converting the vector to other data types:

```{r 03coercion, warning=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
my_vector <- c(1L, 0.2, "ggplot", FALSE)
my_vector

class(my_vector)

as.numeric(my_vector)

as.integer(my_vector)

as.factor(my_vector)

as.logical(my_vector)
```

When changing the data type of our `character` vector, some values are successfully converted (e.g. `1L` and `0.2` as `numeric` or `FALSE` as `logical`) while some are "wrongly" interpreted (e.g. `0.2` is converted into `0L` as `integer` or `FALSE` into `"FALSE"` as `character`). Some others are stored as `NA` representing *unknown, not available values* (e.g. `"ggplot"` as `numeric` or `1` as `logical`). Conversion between different data types is very useful but be careful and always inspect the output of the conversion for potential coercion mistakes.

Another important data type is the `Date` class. Dates are either represented as the number of days since a specified origin or converted `character` type with a structure of YYYY-MM-DD:

```{r 03classesDate, collapse=TRUE}
class(bikes$date)

as.Date(1, origin = "1970-01-01")

as.Date("2007-06-10")

as.Date("2022-09-16") - as.Date("2007-06-10")
```

Furthermore, `POSIXct` and `POSIXlt` are able to represent full time stamps including a date and time. The two POSIX date/time classes only differ in the way that the values are stored internally.

```{r 03classesDatetime, collapse=TRUE}
as.POSIXct("2007-06-10 12:34:56")

as.POSIXlt("2007-06-10 12:34:56")
```


### Data preparation {#preparation}

Often, the data imported might not be in the right format to plot it with **{ggplot2}**. The preparation of the data—e.g. converting data types and setting factor levels, aggregating values, estimating data summaries, reshaping the data set or combining it with another source—is called *data wrangling*, *data munging*, or **data manipulation**.  

To explore and retrieve summary estimates of individual variables, the following functions are useful:

-   `min()`, `max()`, `range()` to extract extremes of numerical data
-   `quantile()` to get an idea of the distribution numerical data
-   `unique()` to get all unique entries, helpful for categorical data
-   `length(unique())` to count all unique entries

```{r, inspectDataVars, collapse=TRUE}
min(bikes$temp) ## add na.rm = TRUE in case it returns `NA`

range(bikes$date)

quantile(bikes$count)

unique(bikes$day_night)

length(unique(bikes$weather_type))
```

The [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) [@dplyr] and other **{tidyverse}** packages provide a simple and intuitive syntax to wrangle data. There are a ton of unique functions, but knowing a handful is enough to empower you to bring your data in the right format. 

#### Data wrangling with the {dplyr} package {#dplyr}

There are five main functions of **{dplyr}**, called *verbs*:

-  `filter()`: Pick rows with matching criteria
-  `select()`: Pick columns with matching criteria
-  `arrange()`: Reorder rows
-  `mutate()`: Create new variables
-  `summarize()` or `summarise()`: Sum up variables

All of these functions follow a consistent syntax: `verb(data, condition)`. Note that we specify the data and columns individually and that within the tidyverse, column names are referred to without quotation marks:

```{r 03dplyrVerbs, eval=FALSE}
## only keep more than 1000 shares during the night
filter(bikes, day_night == "night", count > 1000) 

## only keep 4 columns and reorder those
select(bikes, date, count, weather_type, temp) 

## order by day_night and decreasing bike shares
arrange(bikes, day_night, -count) 

## add a column with temperature encoded as °F
mutate(bikes, temp_fahrenheit = temp * 1.8 + 32)

## calculate the mean count across all observations
summarize(bikes, count_avg = mean(count)) 
```

Another important and very powerful function from the **{dplyr}** package is `group_by()`: when a data set is grouped into subsets, we can apply any operation for each group *within a single data frame*. While you could nest those functions, the common approach within the tidyverse is the use of *pipes*. Pipes take the output of one function and send it directly to the next which avoids nested operations and allows for a more logical order of functions and their arguments. The **{tidyverse}** pipe is encoded as `%>%`; a base R pipe is available as `|>` as well. Have a look at the following silly example:

```{r 03pipeGetToWork, eval=FALSE}
## nested functions, read inside out + disconnected function inputs
go_to_work(
  breakfast(
    wake_up(
      Cedric, alarm = "06:30")
    ), 
    c("coffee", "croissant")
  ),
  mode = "bus", delay = 10
)

## piped version with "Cedric" passed to the next function call
Cedric %>% 
  wake_up(alarm = "06:30")) %>% 
  breakfast(c("coffee", "croissant") %>% 
  go_to_work(mode = "bus", delay = 10)
```

Let's create the workflow for some serious data preparation: In a first step, we are going to estimate the average temperature for night rents per year and season:

```{r 03dataPrep1}
bikes_summarized <- 
  bikes %>% 
  ## only keep night observations
  filter(day_night == "night") %>% 
  ## create 8 subsets (4 seasons x 2 years)
  group_by(season, year) %>% 
  ## calculate total counts and mean temperature per subgroup
  summarize(
    count = sum(count), 
    temp_avg = mean(temp)
  )

bikes_summarized
```

After filtering out "day" cases, the grouping by `season` and `year` allows us to summarize counts and average temperatures for each of the eight groups. Note that the resulting tibble is still grouped by `season` (as shown in the output with the `[4]` explicitly stating the number of current subsets).

In a next step, we regroup our data to add a column with shares of nightly bike rents per season on a yearly basis. Afterwards, we remove all subsets by calling `ungroup()` and clean our data set by reordering and removing columns and sorting rows by year and season:

```{r 03dataPrep2}
bikes_summarized %>% 
  ## add column with relative shares per year
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(share_year = count / sum(count)) %>% 
  ## remove grouping
  ungroup() %>% 
  ## reorder columns and remove days column
  select(year, season, count, share_year, temp_avg) %>% 
  ## sort by year and season
  arrange(year, season) 
```

#### Reshaping data with the {tidyr} package {#tidyr}

In case you need to reshape a data set to make it work with **{ggplot2}**, you can use the functions `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` from the [**`{tidyr}`** package](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) [@tidyr] to move from one format to the other. Let's illustrate their behavior using one of the toy data sets used in section 

```{r 03pivotExamples}
## create long-format data as showcased in section 2
data_long <- tibble::tibble(
  group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), 4),
  year = rep(rep(c("2022", "2023"), each = 3), 2),
  metric = c(rep("x", 6), rep("y", 6)),
  value = c(46, 2, 21, 32, 16, 7, 12, 35, 24, 1, 42, 27)
)

## print long-format data
head(data_long, 5)

## turn long-format data into wide-format data
data_wide <- tidyr::pivot_wider(
  data = data_long,        ## the long data set
  names_from = metric,     ## new column names
  values_from = value,     ## values to be filled in
  names_prefix = "metric_" ## adjust new column names
)

## print wide-format data
data_wide

## turn wide-format data back to long-format data
data_long_again <- tidyr::pivot_longer(
  data = data_wide,             ## the wide data set
  cols = c(metric_x, metric_y), ## columns to pivot
  names_to = "metric",          ## column to hold variable
  values_to = "value",          ## column to hold values
  names_prefix = "metric_"      ## adjust new variable names
)
```
